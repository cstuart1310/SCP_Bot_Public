A.N.N.I.E is my twitter bot which replies to people's tweets with links to any SCPs that are mentioned.

The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization documented by the web-based collaborative-fiction project of the same name. Individuals can contribute to the project by writing their own SCP articles, many of which fit within either the horror or science-fiction genres.

SCP articles all follow the title format "SCP - Number", eg "SCP - 173". My twitter bot searches for people mentioning SCPs, then replies to them with a link to the relevant article, meaning that they do not need to manually look for it.

Got a way to bring her back to life? Let me know!
